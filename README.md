# GraphQL Landscape

![GraphQL Landscape Logo](https://landscape.graphql.org/images/left-logo.svg)

This landscape is intended as a map to explore the GraphQL Ecosystem, and also shows the member companies of the GraphQL Foundation. It is modeled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) and based on the same open-source code.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [GraphQL Landscape](https://landscape.graphql.org). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## New Entries

The requirements for adding new entries for open source projects in the visual and special effects industries is as follows:

* Projects must be open source and hosted on or mirrored to GitHub.
* Projects with at least 300 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included. Put the project in the single category where it best fits.
* Projects that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included. Put the project in the single category where it best fits. We are unlikely to create a new category for projects as we'd rather find the best home with the current options.
* Projects a logo, and the logo needs to include the name.

If you think your project should be included, please open a pull request to add it to [landscape.yml](landscape.yml). For the logo, upload an SVG to the `hosted_logos` directory.

## Corrections

Please open a pull request with edits to [landscape.yml](landscape.yml).

If the error is with data from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), you should open an account there and edit the data. If you don't like a project description, edit it in GitHub. If your project isn't showing the license correctly, you may need to paste the unmodified text of the license into a LICENSE file at the root of your project in GitHub so that GitHub can serve the license information correctly.

### Updating GraphQL Foundation Members

GraphQL Foundation Member data in this repository ( which in the [landscape.yml](landscape.yml) file are under the category `GraphQL Foundation Member` ) are built nightly using the [LFX Landscape Tools](https://github.com/jmertic/lfx-landscape-tools).  Any changes made directly in the data files in this repository for the above-referenced category will be overwritten.

- For `GraphQL Foundation Member` entries, you can make these changes in [LFX Organization Dashboard](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/organization-dashboard/organization-profile).

If you cannot access the above resources, please [create a helpdesk ticket](https://members.aswf.io) to request those changes.

## Local Build and Install

You can build the landscape locally on your machine using the [landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) tool. Once [installed](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can use the commands below to build the landscape and serve it locally.

```shell
landscape2 build --data-file landscape.yml --settings-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/landscape2-sites/refs/heads/main/graphql/settings.yml --logos-path hosted_logos --output-dir build
landscape2 serve --landscape-dir build
```
