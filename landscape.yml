              The GraphQL Specification project is a collaborative effort with the GraphQL Foundation, the Linux Foundation and the Joint Development
              Foundation, which provides open source projects with a swift path to standardization for open specifications. Developers will have an open GraphQL
              specification and open source software implementations available for designing conformant APIs.
